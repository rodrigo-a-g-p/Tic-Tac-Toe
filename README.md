# Tic Tac Toe

This project consists of the game of Tic Tac Toe.

In this game a board with three rows and three columns is presented and
two players compete to be the first to fill any three sequential squares.

The two players are designated by the letters:
* X
* O

The three sequential squares permutations consist of three horizontal lines (the three rows of the board); 
three vertical lines (the three columns of the board); and two diagonal lines 
(the top-down diagonal and the down-top diagonal). In total there are eight 
different winning permutations where a player can fill three sequential squares.

The game is supposed to be played in the Python console. The player making his/her
move must write any digit from 1 to 9, with each digit referencing a different square on the board.

* The square on the first-row, first-column is designated by 1;
* The square on the first-row, second-column is designated by 2;
* The square on the first-row, third-column is designated by 3;
* The square on the second-row, first-column is designated by 4;
* The square on the second-row, second-column is designated by 5;
* The square on the second-row, third-column is designated by 6;
* The square on the third-row, first-column is designated by 7;
* The square on the third-row, second-column is designated by 8;
* The square on the third-row, third-column is designated by 9;
